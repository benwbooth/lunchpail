# Lunchpail

Your retro game collection, ready to play.

Lunchpail is a free, open-source game library and emulator frontend for **Windows,
macOS, and Linux**. Browse your collection, discover artwork and translations,
set up controllers, and launch games from one place—at your desk or on the couch.

## What you can do

- **Bring your games together.** Import ROMs and disc images, or manage
  selected-file downloads with optional Minerva and qBittorrent integration.
- **Browse and organize.** Box-art grids, sortable lists, search, favorites,
  collections, regional releases, and play history.
- **Explore each game.** Descriptions, artwork, video previews, manuals, music,
  and interactive 3D boxes, with optional media-provider integrations.
- **Play your way.** Launch RetroArch or standalone emulators, choose defaults
  per system or game, and configure controller mappings for supported emulators.
- **Pick up where you left off.** Automatic save-state resume and save backups
  for supported emulators, including a local folder managed by your sync app.
- **Make it look right.** CRT and handheld LCD display shaders, plus system or game-specific bezels,
  with aspect-ratio-preserving artwork on ultrawide displays.
- **Try translations and mods.** Find community patches inside Lunchpail or
  import your own; patched copies leave the original ROM or disc image untouched.
- **Add extras.** RetroArch cheats, RetroAchievements account setup, and
  per-game options such as supported arcade blood settings.
- **Move to the couch.** Cover wall, 3D album, animated logo wheel and classic
  shelf views, with themes, attract mode and access to all game and library tools.

Development builds also include [voice and text conversations](docs/couch-mode.md#assistant-and-voice-setup):
choose a bundled model, Codex, Claude Code, Ollama or API provider in Settings, then talk to Lunchpail in
normal mode (**Ask AI / Ctrl+J**) or Couch Mode. Both share a conversation and navigate the current
mode without switching it. Bundled CPU/GPU runtimes require no separate Ollama installation.

Experimental local AI translation is also available for supported RetroArch
setups. It is opt-in per game, uses OCR and Ollama on a supported GPU, and has a
guided setup wizard. GPU OCR is not yet included in the Linux AppImage or
Flatpak packages. See [translation requirements](docs/translation.md).

## Install

Lunchpail was previously named Lunchbox. Starting with **v0.1.3**, the downloads,
installed app, and executables use the Lunchpail name. Existing settings and
saves are preserved when upgrading. Older releases keep their original names.

| Your computer | Installation options |
| --- | --- |
| Windows x86-64 | [MSI installer or portable ZIP](#windows) |
| Apple Silicon Mac, macOS 13+ | [Homebrew or DMG](#macos) |
| Linux x86-64 | [Flatpak or AppImage](#linux) |
| Linux x86-64 / ARM64, Apple Silicon Mac | [Nix](#nix-and-nixos) |

Intel Mac packages are not available. Normal packages do not require Nix or Docker.

### Windows

- **Installer:** [Download the MSI](https://github.com/benwbooth/lunchpail/releases/download/v0.1.3/Lunchpail-windows-x86_64.msi)
  and run it. Open the installed app from the Start menu.
- **Portable:** [Download the ZIP](https://github.com/benwbooth/lunchpail/releases/download/v0.1.3/Lunchpail-windows-x86_64.zip),
  extract the whole folder, and open `Lunchpail/bin/lunchpail.exe`. Keep its accompanying files
  together. The ZIP is portable; your settings and saves still use your user folders.

To update, close Lunchpail and install the newer MSI, or extract the newer ZIP into
a fresh folder. Your library settings are kept separately.

### macOS

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed:

```sh
brew install --cask benwbooth/lunchpail/lunchpail
```

Update with `brew update` followed by `brew upgrade --cask lunchpail`.
The [Lunchpail tap](https://github.com/benwbooth/homebrew-lunchpail) tracks stable releases.

Prefer a regular download? [Open the DMG](https://github.com/benwbooth/lunchpail/releases/download/v0.1.3/Lunchpail-macos-arm64.dmg)
and drag the app into **Applications**. To update, quit it and replace
the application with the newer copy. Both options require Apple Silicon and macOS 13+.

### Linux

**Flatpak — recommended for managed updates.** First [install Flatpak for your distribution](https://flatpak.org/setup/).
Then [open the Lunchpail installer](https://benwbooth.github.io/lunchpail/lunchpail.flatpakref)
in Discover / your software manager, or run:

```sh
flatpak install --user https://benwbooth.github.io/lunchpail/lunchpail.flatpakref
flatpak run io.github.benwbooth.Lunchpail
```

This adds the signed Lunchpail repository and offers to add Flathub for the KDE
runtime. Future updates appear in your software manager, or run `flatpak update --user`.
Lunchpail is hosted in its own repository, not on Flathub.
Already using the old Lunchbox Flatpak repository? See the
[update URL instructions](docs/installing.md#linux) to keep receiving updates.

To add the repository separately:

```sh
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists lunchpail https://benwbooth.github.io/lunchpail/lunchpail.flatpakrepo
```

**AppImage — a single downloadable app.**
[Download the AppImage](https://github.com/benwbooth/lunchpail/releases/download/v0.1.3/Lunchpail-linux-x86_64.AppImage),
then run these commands from your download folder:

```sh
chmod +x Lunchpail-linux-x86_64.AppImage
./Lunchpail-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

To update, replace the AppImage with the latest download. If your distribution
reports a missing FUSE library, use Flatpak or try
`./Lunchpail-linux-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run`.

**Standalone Flatpak bundle.** For a manual install, download the
[`.flatpak` file](https://github.com/benwbooth/lunchpail/releases/download/v0.1.3/Lunchpail-linux-x86_64.flatpak):

```sh
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user ./Lunchpail-linux-x86_64.flatpak
```

Prefer the installer above for repository updates. The repository archive
release asset is for self-hosting; you do not need to unpack it to install Lunchpail.

### Nix and NixOS

With [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) installed and flakes enabled, run the
renamed development version without adding it to your profile:

```sh
nix run github:benwbooth/lunchpail
```

Or install it persistently:

```sh
nix profile install github:benwbooth/lunchpail#lunchpail
```

For NixOS, add Lunchpail to your system flake:

```nix
inputs.lunchpail.url = "github:benwbooth/lunchpail";
```

Then add its package in a module that receives your flake inputs:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  inputs.lunchpail.packages.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.lunchpail
];
```

Rebuild NixOS normally. Update your lock file to get newer changes. You can append
a release tag to the input URL once a Lunchpail-named release is published.
Nix may compile the app and dependencies; it is not the quickest first install.

### Build from source

The easiest source build uses the included Nix environment:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/benwbooth/lunchpail.git
cd lunchpail
nix build .#lunchpail
./result/bin/lunchpail
```

See [Building from source](docs/building.md) for development details. Published
packages and `SHA256SUMS` are on the [release page](https://github.com/benwbooth/lunchpail/releases/latest).
The Windows installer is unsigned, and the macOS app is not notarized yet. Follow
your OS's per-app security prompt after verifying the download. Do not disable system-wide
security protections. The Flatpak repository is signed separately.

## Get started

1. Install Lunchpail using one of the options above.
2. Open Lunchpail, choose your storage folders, and use **Library → Import ROMs**
   to add your games. Media accounts and qBittorrent downloads are optional.
3. Select a game, choose an emulator, and press **Play**. Open
   **Settings & mappings** in Game details when you want to customize it.

Lunchpail is under active development. These screenshots and feature notes reflect
the current source; check release notes for what's in each downloadable version.
Games and BIOS files are not included. Use content you have the right to use.

## On the couch

Browse the same collection with a gamepad, keyboard, or mouse.

Screenshots show a configured library. Game artwork belongs to its respective
rights holders; available media depends on your collection and connected providers.
